🛠️ My Contributions

As a core contributor and technical lead, I was deeply involved in multiple facets of the project:
👥 Developer Leadership & Task Management

    Acted as a team lead and curator, organizing workflows and prioritizing feature development across multiple contributors.

    Established a task management system using Taiga & Custom Admin Panel to coordinate daily tasks and long-term planning.

    Facilitated weekly standups and retrospectives, maintaining a healthy dev rhythm and velocity.

⚙️ Technical Architecture & Infrastructure

    Designed and implemented with developers a microservice-oriented backend using:

        Spring Boot, gRPC, and Apache Kafka for inter-service communication.

        Built RESTful and real-time services for player stats, matchmaking, events, and game logic.

    Worked on infrastructure automation:

        Dockerized all services.

        CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

        Infrastructure deployed on Ubuntu servers.

☕ Learning and Developing in Java

    Took a deep dive into Java 8 and 17, learning the language while developing production systems.

    Reverse-engineered and extended Minecraft 1.7.10 codebase:

        Implemented custom mechanics, AI behaviors, rendering changes, and UI systems.

        Worked with Netty, packet buffers, and custom client-server protocols.

🧱 Minecraft Engine Modification

    Rebuilt several core systems:

        Inventory logic, world events, project architecture, and real-time environment response.

        Refactor full minecraft architecture for other developers to hook into codebase more easier.

    Created with developers a fully custom launcher with custom authorization for our game.

📊 Monitoring & Analytics

    Integrated Grafana + Clickhouse dashboards to visualize:

        Player retention, game event frequency, crashes, and server performance.

    Created in-game event logging system with Kafka producers pushing to analytical DB.

🌐 Admin & Web Panel

    Developed internal tools using:

        Nest.js for all backend services.

        React for game website.

        Angular for admin frontend.
